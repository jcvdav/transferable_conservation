# The repository contains many different files. The purpose of this script is to
# provide the minimum necesary information for QUASI-replication of our findings
# and figures. If you want an exact replication, take a look at the script called
# "scripts/04_analysis/02_all_segments_all_scenarios.R". This script is provided
# just as a minimum reproducible example. The script was also produced AFTER the
# paper had been accepted, and no output of this script is used in our work.
#
# The script proceeds as follows:
# STEP 1 - Two packages are loaded: here (for path management) and the tidyverse
# STEP 2 -  A source directory is indicated
# STEP 3 -  Load supply curves. Each "bubble policy" has two sets of them.
#   One set is the bubble-eez level supply curve (e.g.: Mexico-by-realm)
#   The other set is the aggregate bubble-level suppl curve (e.g. by realm).
# STEP 4 - A function is defined. See further details there, but all it does is
#   filter each set of supply curves based on a target. It then sums across the
#   pixel-level  costs to get the total costs under BAU and under MKT. It then
#   calculates the relative gains as (BAU - MKT) / BAU.
# STEP 5 - The function is called 455 times: 5 bubble policies X 91 conservation
#   targets (from 10% to 100% in 1% increments)
# STEP 6 - Results are combined into a data-frame and two figures are produced:
#   - A bar chart showing gains form trade under 30 by 30 for 5 bubble policies
#   - A line chart showing gains from trade for different targets and policies

## PROCESSING ##################################################################

# STEP 4: Define a gft function --------------------------------------------------------
# gft = "Gains From Trade". This is a quick and dirty function to get the gains from trade,
# without paying attention to who pays / gets paid, and fractional pixels. The 
# process is simple and involves two filters:
# - Under BAU, all nations protect along their individual supply curves up to the target.
#   The costs is the total cost is the area under the curve
# - Under MKT, protection is done along the aggregate supply curve.
gft <- function(tar, group = "global", ind = eez_cb, agg = eez_h_sum_cb) {
  # BAU
  bau <- ind %>% # Uses the eez-by-bubble policy supply curves
    group_by_at(group) %>% 
    filter(pct <= tar) %>%# Under BAU, all nations protect up to the target
    pull(cost) %>% 
    sum()
  
  mkt <- agg %>% # Uses the aggregate supply curves
    group_by_at(group) %>% 
    filter(pct <= tar) %>% # Under BAU, the world protects up to the target
    pull(cost) %>% 
    sum()
  
  gains <- (bau - mkt) / bau
  
  return(gains)
}

targets <- seq(0.1, 1, by = 0.01)

# STEP 5: Call the function ----------------------------------------------------
global <- map_dbl(targets, gft)
hemisphere <- map_dbl(targets, gft, group = "hemisphere", ind = hem_eez_cb, agg = hem_h_sum)
realm <- map_dbl(targets, gft, group = "realm", ind = rlm_eez_cb, agg = rlm_h_sum)
